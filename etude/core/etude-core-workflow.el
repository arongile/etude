;;  ETUDE CORE WORKFLOW
;;
;;  This package standardizes actions and the etude menu system. All global
;;  keybindings as well as menus are defined. `:keyword`s are used to specify
;;  the action performed. The action is associated with keybindings and a function
;;  definition. Menus are then created from actions. This results in a cleaner
;;  way of configuring the emacs environment.
;;
;;  The menu system is based on a number system, as opposed to a letter abbreviation
;;  system. It follows something like an automated phone directory to assist
;;  the user in picking the right choice. The aim is to simplify movement and order
;;  functionality, not merely to overwhelm the user with options.
;;
;;  - Global                           [quit, menu]
;;  - Editing                          [cut, copy, paste, undo]
;;  - Function Keys        (F1-12)
;;  - Window Management    (M-`)       
;;  - File Management      (M-1)       [open, save, close, quit]
;;  - Navigation           (M-2)       [goto, jump, mark]
;;  - Mode Specific        (M-3)       
;;  - Project Management   (M-4)       [find, replace, bulk find, bulk replace] 
;;  - Code Management      (M-5)       [history, status, commit, push]
;;  - App Management       (M-9)       [eshell]
;;  - Config Management    (M-0)       [jump to config]
